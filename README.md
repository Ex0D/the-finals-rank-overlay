# How to use

I encourage to try on your favorite browser before doing the OBS part.

- Save the file overlay.html on your desktop.
- Retrieve the local url to the file (Example : file:///C:/<PATH_TO_THE_FILE>) and add a "?" at the end of it
- Add the following string to the url with your customisation :

embarkIdName=**YOUR_EMBARK_NAME_HERE**&embarkIdNumber=**YOUR_EMBARK_NUMBER_HERE**&textColor=**TEXT_COLOR_HEXADECIMAL**&backgroundColor=**BACKGROUND_COLOR_HEXADECIMAL**&fontFamily=**FONT_FAMILY**
  
- Only the first 2 parameters are required, the rest can be ommited if not needed. The above string must be set on the right of the "?"
# OBS setup

- Create a browser source on OBS with the same final URL create above (Width : 470 and Height: 160)
- It refreshes automatically every 5 minutes so you just can place it wherever you want
- Have fun !
